🧬 CODE ASTRAA - Disease Prediction Tool
A Revolution in Healthcare using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
CODE ASTRAA is a machine learning-based application that predicts diseases from symptoms entered by the user. It uses datasets and classification models to make accurate predictions, aimed at assisting healthcare diagnostics.

✅ Requirements
Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed. Required Python libraries include:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn (optional for visualization)
📦 Install Dependencies
Run the following command in the project directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is not available, install manually:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
🚀 How to Run the Project
▶️ Option 1: Run using Python CLI
python app.py
Ensure your terminal is in the project directory and app.py has the main logic for running the application.

▶️ Option 2: Run using Streamlit (if Streamlit UI is used)
streamlit run app.py
🧪 Sample Execution
Enter symptoms: cough, fever, headache
Predicted Disease: Flu
📈 Future Enhancements
Enhanced UI with Streamlit or Flask
Integration with real-time symptom databases
Patient history tracking
